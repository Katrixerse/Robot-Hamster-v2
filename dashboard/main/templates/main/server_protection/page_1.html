    <span class="fs-5 text-gray">Server captcha is a feature that makes it so when a new user joins, they have to solve a captcha first. A captcha is a distorted image with some text in it, text which the new member has to enter in order to be able to talk in your server.</span>
    <span class="fs-5 text-gray"><span class="text-orange">Why?</span> Using this feature is <span class="text-danger">extremely effective against raids</span>, since it is very hard for bots to detect the text in the image.</span>
